    "##### Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to support more than one processor at the same time. Applications in a multiprocessing system are broken to smaller routines that run independently. The operating system allocates these threads to the processors improving performance of the system.\n",
    "##### Consider a computer system with a single processor. If it is assigned several processes at the same time, it will have to interrupt each task and switch briefly to another, to keep all of the processes going.\n",

    "##### Multithreading is a technique where multiple threads are spawned by a process to do different tasks, at about the same time, just one after the other. This gives you the illusion that the threads are running in parallel, but they are actually run in a concurrent manner. In Python, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents the threads from running simultaneously.\n",
    "##### Multiprocessing is a technique where parallelism in its truest form is achieved. Multiple processes are run across multiple CPU cores, which do not share the resources among them. Each process can have many threads running in its own memory space. In Python, each process has its own instance of Python interpreter doing the job of executing the instructions."
